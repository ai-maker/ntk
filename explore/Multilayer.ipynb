      "# Multilayer Perceptron\n",
      "\n",
      "Some say that 9 out of 10 people who use neural networks apply a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). A MLP is basically a feed-forward network with 3 layers (at least): an input layer, an output layer, and a hidden layer in between. Thus, the MLP has no structural loops: information always flows from left (input)to right (output). The lack of inherent feedback saves a lot of headaches. Its analysis is totally straightforward given that the output of the network is always a function of the input, it does not depend on any former state of the model or previous input.\n",

      "![Multilayer Perceptron topology](files/multilayer.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the topology of a MLP it is normally assumed to be a densely-meshed one-to-many link model between the layers. This is mathematically represented by two matrices of parameters named \u201cthe thetas\u201d. In any case, if a certain connection is of little relevance with respect to the observable training data, the network will automatically pay little attention to its contribution and assign it a low weight close to zero.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Prediction\n",
      "\n",
      "The evaluation of the output of a MLP, i.e., its prediction, given an input vector of data is a matter of matrix multiplication. To that end, the following variables are described for convenience:\n",
      "* $N$ is the dimension of the input layer.\n",
      "* $H$ is the dimension of the hidden layer.\n",
      "* $K$ is the dimension of the output layer.\n",
      "* $M$ is the dimension of the corpus (number of examples).\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the variables above, the parameters of the network, i.e., the thetas matrices, are defined as follows:\n",
      "* $\\theta^{(IN)} \\rightarrow H \\times (N+1)$\n",
      "* $\\theta^{(OUT)} \\rightarrow K \\times (H+1)$\n",
      "\n",
      "The thetas are randomly initialised with small numbers."

      "\n",
      "Training a neural network essentially means fitting its parameters to a set of example data considering an objective function, aka cost function. This process is also known as supervised learning. It is usually implemented as an iterative procedure.\n",

      "\n",
      "The cost function somehow encodes the objective or goal that should be attained with the network. It is usually defined as a classification or a regression evaluation function. However, the actual form of the cost function is effectively the same, which is an error or fitting function.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cost function $J$ quantifies the amount of error (or misfitting) that the network displays with respect to a set of data. Thus, in order to achieve a successfully working model, this cost function must be minimised with an adequate set of parameter values. To do so, several solutions are valid as long as this cost function be a convex function (i.e., a bowl-like shape). A well known example of such is the quadratic function, which trains the neural network considering a minimum squared error criterion over the whole dataset of training examples:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$J(\\theta, x) = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{m=1}^M \\sum_{k=1}^K \\left(t_k^{(m)}-y_k^{(m)}\\right)^2$$\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that the term $t$ in the cost function represents the target value of the network (i.e., the ideal/desired network output) for a given input data value $x$. Now that the cost function can be expressed, a convex optimisation procedure (e.g., a gradient-based method) must be conducted in order to minimise its value. Note that this is essentially a least-squares regression."

      "One last remark should be made about the amount of examples $M$. If the training procedure considers several instances at once per cost computation, i.e., $M \\gg 1$, the approach is called batch learning. Batch learning is slow because each cost computation accounts for all the available training instances. In contrast, it is usual to consider only one training instance at a time, i.e., $M=1$, in order to speed up the iterative learning process. This procedure is called online learning. Online learning steps are faster to compute, but this single-instance approximation of the cost function makes it a little inaccurate around the optimum. However, online learning is rather convenient in most cases."
